## 🧰 Safe Handling — High-level (non-actionable)

This README intentionally avoids operational details that would enable spreading or weaponization. Follow institutional best-practices and supervision.

- Use isolated, disposable environments for analysis (sandboxed emulators or physically air-gapped devices).  
- Do **not** run samples on personal or network-connected hardware.  
- Preserve snapshots or take konservative forensic captures if your environment supports them.  
- Avoid uploading samples to public/cloud services unless those services explicitly support malware research and your use complies with their terms.  
- Document and redact sensitive information when sharing analysis outputs publicly.
